Kodekloud Engineer Labs - Tasks
This repository contains all my notes for past Kodekloud Engineer tasks which are all performed in a live Linux environment. These tasks simulate actual enterprise challenges and mimics the day-to-day work of System Administrators and Devops Engineers.

For each task, a set of requirements are given. The documentations for the servers are also provided. It is up for the "engineer" to find the solution for each problem.

To learn more, check out Kodekloud Engineer-Getting Started.
